## Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js ≥ 14.x  
- Python ≥ 3.8  
- Google Cloud API credentials for Vertex AI  
- Vercel / Render accounts (for deployment)

### Local Setup

#### 1. Clone the repository

## Set up the backend
- cd backend
- python main.py

## Set up the frontend:
- cd frontend
- npm install
- npm start

## Usage Guide

1. Open the application in your browser (e.g., [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)).
2. Enter your:
   - Monthly rent
   - Property price and deposit
   - Mortgage rate, term, and related ownership costs
   - Expected investment return if renting
3. Click **"Calculate"** to generate a side-by-side, year-by-year financial comparison.
4. Use the **chat assistant** to receive clear, AI-generated explanations of the results and related financial concepts.
5. Adjust values to test new scenarios, such as different timeframes, property values, or financial strategies.

> Tip: Use the chatbot to explore *"what if I..."* questions like:
> - "What if rent grows faster than inflation?"
> - "How much would I save by investing instead of buying?"

## Known Limitations

Despite delivering a functional and educational prototype, the current system has several limitations:

- **No login or saved scenarios**: User data is not stored; session is temporary.
- **Simplified tax logic**: Does not yet account for capital gains tax, remortgaging, or income from letting.
- **No live API integrations**: Property price, rent inflation, and mortgage data are entered manually.
- **Limited data visualizations**: Results are shown in text only; graphs and timelines are not yet implemented.
- **AI model limitations**: In rare cases, AI responses may be overly generic or slightly repetitive.

---

## Planned Features

To extend functionality and user value, the following improvements are planned:

- **Real-time APIs** for Rightmove, Zoopla, and Bank of England mortgage rates
- **Graph-based visualizations** for:
  - Rent vs buy breakeven timelines
  - Net equity growth over time
  - Investment return vs homeownership
- **User authentication** with saved scenario history and dashboards
- **International adaptation**, starting with US, EU, and Canadian tax/mortgage models
- **Fine-tuned AI assistant** using anonymized user data (with opt-in)
