# Rent-vs-Buy-Analysis
This project helps users make informed decisions about renting versus buying a home by comparing the financial impact over time, based user-specific inputs and economic conditions. It is designed for individuals, financial advisors, and researchers interested in the housing market. Key features include:
* **Financial Modeling**: Computes total costs over time for both renting and buying, taking into account mortgage payments, rent inflation, property appreciation, taxes, and maintenance
* **Sensitivity Analysis**: Examines the impact of changing economic variables (e.g. interest rates, property value growth) on the rent vs. buying decision.
* **Interactive Dashboard**: A user-friendly interface built with either Power BI or Streamlit that allows users to input their data and visualise personalised cost comparisons.
